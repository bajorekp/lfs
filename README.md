# LFS

Linux From Scratch built on Docker for ARM processor (including Apple M1).

The build is based on [Cross LFS book](https://clfs.org/~kb0iic/lfs-systemd) generated from [lfs-arm repo](https://github.com/cross-lfs/lfs-arm#systemd).

Directory `lfs-commands` is generated by [jhalfs script](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/download.html) for v11 version of the book. If you want to upgrade the build, you can do that by generating newer version of it by running the script again.
